			  <div id="MyStory">
                    
					<p>I knew from the start that this project was never going to be a walk in the park for me and that there would be a lot of 
					challenges I would have to overcome. The fact that I had failed in this very subject in my previous semester was the biggest
					weight I had to bear and made my question myself at the start. But I had some positives to take away from this failure that 
					would help me come back stronger this time around. Last semester, my biggest mistake was taking up this project individually 
					rather than working with a team. This time I had a team with me on the project and through their support, the burden of my 
					dejections from last semester only got lighter along the way and gave me a huge boost in confidence for performing better in 
					my second try.</p>
					<p>We faced a setback early into our project when the representative of the company who was communicating with us for our
					buddy support project never got back to us. We had spent quite some time preparing for the meeting with her as we noted down 
					all the information that we required and questions we had to ask the representative that would help us better understand what
					was to be asked of us and how to go about the project. But despite trying hard for about two weeks to get in touch with the 
					representative, we never got a response. The delay caused to us by this and looking at our peers already start working on their 
					projects had dented our hopes and created a sense of chaos amongst us. At this time, we decided to seek the help from our lecturer
					Adon, and requested him to advise us on how to proceed from this dead end. After his attempt to establish a communication also 
					failed, he gave us a new project – Meals on Wheels, which was a huge relief for us because this was a project had been worked on
					the last semester and we had to work on improving it and fixing the bugs of this project. </p>
					<p>As we began to work on our new task, we quickly realised that this project was not going to be as easy as we were hoping
					for it to be, especially for me and another teammate. This was because only the two of us in our group were aware of the
					project and the language/coding that was used in it and the other members had no experience working with this particular
					coding. There was a suggestion to redo the whole project in a simpler language we all knew but, this was not going to be 
					feasible as it would have been really time consuming and in the last semester, there were four teams who were working 
					together on this project. As me and my other teammate Zak were aware of problems we would face to redo the entire project, 
					we strongly opposed this suggestion. We then decided to continue to work the existing project and we had help from Adon who
					advised us on the bugs and other aspects of the project that we had to work on.</p>
					<p>After we knew what had to be done, we started dividing and assigning the work amongst us. This process brought along with
					it, its own hurdles. We lost a teammate soon after starting the project due to an injury. Another problem that we faced was
					on the work front. One of the team member insisted on working on CSS against our advice as this part was relatively easy and
					could be worked on in the later stages.  After failing to convince him, the remaining members, which included me, Zak and Gray
					took it upon ourselves to work on the major parts of the project and left the other member with CSS. We were using Trello to
					keep track of our work and upload all relevant information so that we were up to date about the progress of the project at all
					times and there was no gap in communication/information. A big boost for us came when we found that all the relevant information
					and working from the previous semester was also available in Trello for us to access which was a big help for us. </p>
					<p>Another help for us came from our lecturer, Adon, who was always prompt and supportive when it came to clearing our doubts
					and guide us whenever we required direction. His support was a major factor in improving our abilities while working on the
					project and helped us be more efficient with our work which would not have been possible without his support and guidance. </p>
					<p>The challenge for me came in the form of node.js. This was a language that I had not worked on before. I downloaded Mamp, 
					which was a software that helped to run node.js server. This was on my Otago Polytech profile which came with a major problem.
					Every night the system clean ups would delete Mamp as I downloaded it myself externally and due to this, I had to download the 
					software repeatedly in every class. As a solution, I downloaded this software on my personal laptop which gave me a continuous
					and uninterrupted access and I could now work more freely on my share of the work. As I mentioned earlier about my inexperience
					with node.js, I had to rely heavily on google and stackoverflow to understand and process my share of the work. This helped a me
					a lot in improving my abilities in approach when in unchartered waters and gave me the grit to work hard and complete my share of
					the work no matter the challenges that was to come in front of me.</p>
					<p>One of my initial tasks was to add a general login/off panel to the page. Although I was thorough with my html coding, I
					had no idea on how to incorporate the node.js codes into html. Adon helped me out with this and gave me a very simple solution
					to a problem which no longer seemed challenging.  My next task was to add security for each of the tab on the webpage apart from 
					the ‘About’ tab so that these tabs could not be accessed without authentication. After this, one of the bug that I had fix was to
					take away the ability of general public to simply sign up and access the data. This had to be done as the data was private and to
					be accessed only by the internal staff members. Hence, I changed the authentication setup so that only an admin could log on to the
					page to access the data. This took up a lot of time as the whole coding was already done and I had to do a lot of research on google
					and other relevant materials to make this change without compromising the structural coding of the page. My final task was to add the
					feature to delete registered customers in case of inactivity or any other reason specific to the business. This feature was added in 
					order to give the users the ability to streamline the data if required by removing inactive or maybe incorrect customer data. I also 
					wanted to add the feature to edit the details of existing customers and did try to work on it but, it was very difficult and time-consuming
					and had to let it go.</p>
					<h4>Reflection </h4>
					<p>Looking back at my experience of doing this project, I would conclude that my second attempt was much better than my first try. 
					Despite some disagreeable members, I was happy with the group and the support and teamwork that was put into this project. This gave
					me a lot of experience on how to work effectively in a team and how to handle various situation and decision making especially when
					there is a disagreement within the team. The opportunity to learn new tools such as node.js was also a beneficial experience and which
					I can now add to my skillset. It was a necessary learning curve and I am satisfied with the amount of effort I put into it and excited
					to have learnt so much more than I expected at the end of it. </p>

            <hr>
				<p> Professional proficiency can be defined as one skill that helps an individual to improve their 
				responsibility and liability towards their work.  From the concept of professional proficiency,
				it can be suggested that by this approach it is possible to develop the personal skills of an individual.
				Apart from high level, professional proficiency helps to build communication skills and also with the help 
				of this skill one who have up to date knowledge so and proper education. Apart from that it can also be 
				suggested that professional proficiency can be achieved through some formal education and with the help of
				professional certification.</p>
				<p> In regard to the aspect of professional proficiency, I managed to maintain regular mode of communication 
				with my peers. In this particular aspect I effectively managed to inform my fellow students on the status of
				my progress in the development of the project and also made proper communication with regard to giving them
				proper information on my coming to classes or not. Thus for this part, I believe to have played my role in 
				most efficient manner as this is the base of achieving professional proficiency. There are some factors also
				involved in this particular task and this is the management of time and in that regard also I managed a good
				effort in saving time.</p>
				<p>From the given scenario it is possible to understand in which way communication is related with personal
				proficiency. According to Pearlman et al. (2017), communication generally increases the level of personal
				proficiency. As I am creating a database and I am doing this work with a group, it can be considered as a
				team assignment. Due to some urgency if I am unable to be present for the class or team meeting, then I 
				inform to all of my teammates via facebook or slack. <img src="facebook.png" alt="Facebook" width="331" height="311"><p>
				<p>With the help of this I can easily communicate with my friends and can inform them all the details. 
				Therefore, I inform all of my friends so that my absence does not create as such any kind of problem. Apart from
				that, this kind of attitude provides professional proficiency that is present in my character. From this character
				it is possible to understand that I am very serious over my commitments that helps me display a professional attitude. 
				My proficiency expresses that I can communicate with others in an appropriate manner. Besides that, it is also possible 
				for me to attend any kind of group discussion because I communicate with my friends via any kind of social communicating
				tool.<img src="trello.png" alt="Trello" width="950" height="704"> </p>
				<p>From the given scenario it is possible to understand only proper communication channels can improve professional
				proficiency according to the requirements. To make proper connection with all the volunteers also needs professional
				proficiency. For any kind of group work generally I use slack <img src="slack.png" alt="Slack" width="900" height="559"></p>
				<p>because it is one of the most accessible social network platform and with the help of this tool, I can easily manage
				everything and contact with friends. For any necessicity if I become unavailable I send them that message via slack or
				Facebook. The level of proficiency also developed my responsibility and built or incorporate professional characteristic 
				in my nature. As a result, professional proficiency not only developed my communication skill and responsibility, it also
				developed my decision making ability. From the given scenario, it can be suggested that it is very important to maintain 
				proper communication with the colleagues or with the people, with whom we work. It comes only if someone is professionally
				proficient. From the given scenario it can be suggested that with the help of a correct attitude, it is possible for me to
				sort out any kind of problems. The level of proficiency also developed my responsibility and built or incorporate professional 
				characteristic in my nature.</p>
				<p>
My proficiency is also achieved from proper education and also from real time experience. Sometimes, I chose to send information through 
an email because it is a secure medium for sending delicate communication. Therefore, I prefer email when I have to specifically deal with
 my client and I communicate all the information to my client through email.
<img src="email.png" alt="email" width="900" height="502"></p>
				<p>As per the concept of professional proficiency, it builds self-assessment (González-Sanmamed, Muñoz-Carril & Sangrà, 
				2014). Self review quality in an individual's nature. Apart from that it can be suggested that professional proficiency
				develop confidence and positivity in mind. It can make sure that it becomes possible for me to attend any kind of group
				discussion and make an active participation in all of them. In order to avoid any kind of difficulties during communication 
				period I use trello, github because as it is an efficient source for communcitation and also keep track of the progress of 
				the ongoing project. </p> 
<p>This becomes possible only when someone takes an initiative to work on their communication skills. My professional proficiency also
 increased my receiving and analysing capability. Professional proficiency develops accuracy and also makes some effective characteristic
 changes that sort out any kind of problem. I believe to have played my role in most efficient manner as this is the base of achieving
 professional proficiency. There are some factors also involved in this particular task and this is the management of time and in that
 regard also I managed a good effort in saving time.</p>
<p>
In order to conclude the entire review, it can be said that as a group member it is my duty to maintain proper communication with all
 other group members because from the concept of professional proficiency it can be suggested that communication skill is most important
 to increase the level of proficiency.

					<p><b>A:</b>Self- review- Being a student and being in coding new, I am still in learning process. As I have been taught coding is both technical as well innovative form of technical knowledge, the level of good coding rises with deep learning and keep on working on new features. In this term I review my self as being an intermediate in terms of both technical knowledge as well coding expertise in terms of experience I have in coding. If I have to give my self points in ten , honestly I will give my self six , these six will be more towards my enthusiasm for learning in comparison to technical expertise. </p>

					<p><b>Q2:</b> How well did you follow best practices in development?</p><p>
					</p><p><b>A:</b>Firstly I try to follow the syntax of the programming language sincerely. 
					For any defined function in the program, I personally first design the algorithm
					for the formation of logic for the function and according to the syntax of the programming language
					I convert that algorithm in the programming code . I always get updated with latest trends of
					programming by following the blogs of various eminent software engineers, I practically practice the 
					tips given by them and most importantly our teachers at our Institution.  I along with my fellow friends
					follow error and trial policy in development to have deep learning of the coding.</p>
					Algorithm

<h4>Begin</h4>
<p>Step1  : Assign scope to addNewMR</p>
<p>Step2: Define the console at log</p>
<p>Step3: if newMR entry is not empty</p>
<p>Then <p>
  <p>Assign newMR = category of new entry</p>
<p>Then check meal requirements </p>
<p>Assign the requirement to the newMR category</p>
<p>Now close NewMR and proceed to next MR </p>
<p>Perform same procedure </p>
<p>End</p>

					<p><b>Q3:</b>How well did you use appropriate version control?</p>
					<p><b>A:</b> 
    Version control in programming is one of the most important practice for programmers, the version control help the programmers to work in any programming language according to their own convenient way, these tools  helps the programmers to manage the changes in source code over time. Version control tool keeps track on every modification performed on the software coding. In case the programmers commit any mistake in coding with the help of version control tool the program can compare the logic to the previous version and can do accordingly. Version control tool help to preserve the logic or the programming information in a standard way. 
     Here in order to perform our Version Control we had used –GitHub , an appropriate tool for reviewing the code, managing projects and building the Software together in group.

					<p><b>Q4:</b>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?<br></p>
					<h1>more evidence needed</h1>
					<p><b>A:</b>As a team member I worked with all the team members in designing the basic logic of the overall program, as we have a small team we all worked in unified way for overall project. Some how our team members worked by allocating the work to each other but in final approval we all sit together to accept the work task of the overall project.</p>
