<h1>3D Drawing</h1>
<p>I created a basic 3D tiny house for my 3D drawing assignment. I had used SketchUP before to try and create a basic mode for my shop and the additional practice that I received in the class also helped me for this.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, my previous experience of creating a design for my shop was of significant help to know how to approach this project and what I wanted to create. Apart from this, I browsed various designs on google to seek out inspiration to see if I needed to add more detail to the design I had thought of and any other common elements that were necessary to the design which I may have otherwise missed out on. I also went through various youtube tutorial videos to brush up my knowledge on 3D drawing.</p>

 <h2>Technical considerations</h2>
 <p> I used SketchUP for my 3Dmodelling as it was easy to use and has a very interactive interface which makes it ideal for users who do not have extensive experience on 3D modelling. The editing tools and options available were also pretty basic and not too complicated which helped me a great deal during my modelling process. </p>
