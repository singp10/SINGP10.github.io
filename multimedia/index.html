<h1>About</h1>
<p>This site is an example of a Multimedia Development portfolio assessment. It is designed to
 indicate one way to arrange an online portfolio both to make it easy to mark and to show off the best work.
</P>
</P>The content is also indicative of the style of reflection that can be useful to
 demonstrate technical and professional learning during the semester. 
 This “journaling” or (web)logging style of reflection briefly outlines
 what I’m trying to achieve, how I plan to do it, how that plan works out
 and any challenges and solutions encountered along the way.</P>
